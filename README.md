# Game_Of_Othello

Created a graphical game of Othello using Python and Processing.
Designed and implemented an AI computer player that optimizes its moves to increase its odds of winning.
Wrote unit tests with PyTest to ensure the quality of non-graphical functionalities.
This is the first off-webpage game challenge that I designed and created from scratch based on Wikipedia description and CS5001 HW guideline of NEU Align program
